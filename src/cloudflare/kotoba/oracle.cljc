;; cloudflare.kotoba.oracle — product-shell loader for precompiled pure-request KIR.
;;
;; Authority product-shell pattern (W6 + T6.4 mirror-delete):
;;   1. SSoT source:  kotoba/*_core.kotoba
;;   2. Ship artifact: resources/cloudflare/oracle/*.kir.edn  (precompiled KIR)
;;   3. Host public API delegates here instead of re-implementing pure truth
;;
;; CLJS load (optional, ADR-0014):
;;   - register-kir! — inject pre-parsed KIR (tests / bundlers)
;;   - set-resource-loader! — custom (fn [path] → string)
;;   - nbb/node default: read resources/<path> from process.cwd()
;;
;; Compiler stays test-only. Production needs only kotoba-kir + checked-in resources.

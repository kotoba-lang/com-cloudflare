  "Cloudflare Stream Live -- live inputs and their RTMP live outputs.

  A live input is one ingest endpoint that accepts WHIP/WebRTC, RTMPS or
  SRT and hands Cloudflare the media. Live *outputs* attached to that input
  are what make it useful beyond Cloudflare's own player: Cloudflare
  re-broadcasts the same stream to arbitrary RTMP destinations -- YouTube
  Live, Twitch, anything else that speaks RTMP -- so a browser that can
  only speak WebRTC reaches those platforms without anyone running an
  RTMP encoder.

  Unlike the rest of this library, everything here is split in two:

    `*-request` fns are PURE .cljc -- args -> {:method :path :url :body}.
      They work anywhere, including ClojureScript and nbb, where the
      JVM-only `cloudflare.client/rest!` cannot follow.
    `*!` fns are the :clj convenience layer over `client/rest!`, matching
      cloudflare.pages / cloudflare.workers.

  That split is not decoration. Provisioning a live output means handling a
  destination stream key, which is a broadcast credential -- whoever holds
  it can publish as that channel. Keeping the request shaping pure lets the
  script that actually touches the key run wherever the key already lives,
  instead of forcing a JVM into that path."

            [cloudflare.client :as client]))

(def destinations
  "Ingest URLs for the platforms this library knows by name. `:rtmps` is

  the stream key in the clear on the wire, and Cloudflare is speaking to
  the platform across the public internet."

(defn redact-key
  "A stream key rendered safe to print: first 4 characters, then the length.

                          silently never appears on the platform: the RTMP
                          handshake carries the key verbatim, trailing
                          newline and all.

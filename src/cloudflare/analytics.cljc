  "Cloudflare zone Analytics API (GraphQL): daily traffic trend and
  per-path/device/country/status breakdown. Generalized from
  cloud-itonami.analytics (gftdcojp/cloud-itonami, ADR-0010) -- every
  function here takes an explicit `zone-tag`, no itonami-specific default.

  Two real Cloudflare datasets, with real differences worth knowing before
  using either:

  - `httpRequests1dGroups` (daily-report!): daily aggregate. Any date
    range works on every plan tier.
  - `httpRequestsAdaptiveGroups` (path-report!): per-request granularity
    (path/device/country/status). Free-plan lookback is capped at ~1 day
    -- a wider range fails with a real `quota` GraphQL error, not
    silently-truncated data. `host` is optional: filtering to one host can
    legitimately return zero rows if that host has no traffic in the
    window while the zone as a whole does (a real finding this library's
    first consumer hit, not a bug -- see gftdcojp/cloud-itonami ADR-0010's
    app.itonami.cloud discovery), so omit `host` to see the whole zone
    first before assuming a host-filtered zero means something is broken."
